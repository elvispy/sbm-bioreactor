    navier_stokes_weak_form(u, p, v, q, μ, ρ, f, u_drag=nothing, drag_coeff=0.0)

Compute the weak form of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with an optional 
Hele-Shaw depth-averaged friction term (B.6 in Chao & Das 2015).

# Arguments
- `u`, `p`: Trial velocity and pressure fields.
- `v`, `q`: Test velocity and pressure fields.
- `μ`: Dynamic viscosity (typically depends on particle concentration Φ).
- `ρ`: Mixture density.
- `f`: External body forces (e.g., gravity).
- `u_drag`: Reference velocity for drag (e.g., wall velocity).
- `drag_coeff`: Friction coefficient for depth-averaged flow.

# Physical Meaning
1. `(ρ * (u ⋅ ∇(u)) ⋅ v)`: Inertial term (convection of momentum).
2. `(μ * ∇(u) ⊙ ∇(v))`: Viscous stress term (dissipation).
3. `-(p * (∇ ⋅ v))`: Pressure gradient term.
4. `(q * (∇ ⋅ u))`: Continuity constraint (incompressibility).
5. `-(f ⋅ v)`: Body force term (e.g., buoyancy).
6. `(drag_coeff * (u - u_drag) ⋅ v)`: Hele-Shaw drag representing the out-of-plane 
   viscous resistance in thin-gap bioreactors.

"""
    krieger_viscosity(Φ; μf=0.5889, Φmax=0.64)

Calculate the effective mixture viscosity using the Krieger-Dougherty empirical relation.

# Arguments
- `Φ`: Local particle volume fraction.
- `μf`: Viscosity of the suspending fluid (base fluid).
- `Φmax`: Maximum packing fraction where viscosity diverges (typically ~0.64 for spheres).

# Physical Meaning
Viscosity increases nonlinearly with particle concentration, becoming infinite as Φ 
approaches Φmax, reflecting the transition from a fluid-like to a solid-like state.

"""
    shear_rate(u)

Compute the local shear rate (scalar invariant of the strain rate tensor).

# Arguments
- `u`: Velocity field.

# Physical Meaning
The shear rate Γ = sqrt(2 * ε(u) : ε(u)) quantifies the intensity of local fluid 
deformation, which drives the shear-induced migration of particles.

    particle_flux(u, Φ, ∇Φ, μ, ∇μ, a, ρs, ρf, μf, Φavg, g, Γ, ∇Γ)

Compute the total particle migration flux based on the Suspension Balance Model (SBM).

# Arguments
- `u`, `Φ`, `∇Φ`: Velocity, volume fraction, and its gradient.
- `μ`, `∇μ`: Mixture viscosity and its gradient.
- `a`: Particle radius.
- `ρs`, `ρf`: Particle and fluid densities.
- `μf`: Fluid viscosity.
- `Φavg`: Average volume fraction (used in sedimentation hindrance).
- `g`: Gravity vector.
- `Γ`, `∇Γ`: Local shear rate and its gradient.

# Physical Meaning (Chao & Das 2015)
1. `Jsc = -0.41 * a^2 * Φ * ∇(ΓΦ)`: Shear-induced migration from high to low shear 
   and concentration gradients (particle-particle collisions).
2. `Jsμ = -0.62 * a^2 * Φ^2 * Γ * ∇ln(μ)`: Migration toward lower viscosity regions.
3. `Jst = - (ust) * Φ`: Sedimentation flux due to buoyancy, corrected for hindrance 
   effects at high Φ.
